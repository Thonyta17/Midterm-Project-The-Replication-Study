## Main Causal Question

Did New Jersey's April 1992 minimum wage increase (from $4.25 to $5.05/hour) cause a reduction in fast-food employment, as standard competitive labor market theory predicts? Using Pennsylvania fast-food restaurants as a control group, Card and Krueger compare employment changes before and after the policy change in a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework. Contrary to the classical prediction, they find that employment in New Jersey increased slightly relative to Pennsylvania, challenging the conventional view that minimum wage hikes reduce low-wage employment.
