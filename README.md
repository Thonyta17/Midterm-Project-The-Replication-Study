Causal Question Summary
This project investigates the causal impact of a minimum wage increase on employment levels within the low-wage labor market. Specifically, it asks whether the April 1992 hike in New Jersey’s minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour led to a significant reduction in employment at fast-food restaurants compared to neighboring Pennsylvania, where the wage remained constant. By utilizing a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework, the study seeks to determine if empirical evidence supports the standard competitive model's prediction that higher wage floors necessarily decrease labor demand.
Data Cleaning & PreprocessingThe dataset, sourced from the David Card UC Berkeley archive, required significant preprocessing to be suitable for causal analysis.1. Handling Fixed-Width FormatThe raw public.dat file is an ASCII fixed-width format without headers. I utilized pandas to read the file and manually mapped 46 variables based on the study’s original codebook.2. Missing Value ImputationMissing values in the original dataset are denoted by a period (.). These were converted to NaN and handled using:Listwise deletion for observations missing primary outcome variables (FTE).Mean imputation or exclusion for secondary covariates where appropriate.3. Feature Engineering: Full-Time Equivalents (FTE)To measure employment consistently, I calculated Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) for both Wave 1 (pre-treatment) and Wave 2 (post-treatment) using the Card-Krueger formula:$$FTE = \text{Full-Time Employees} + (0.5 \times \text{Part-Time Employees}) + \text{Managers}$$Methodology: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)To isolate the causal effect of the minimum wage increase, this replication employs a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator. This method controls for omitted variables that are constant over time and those that are constant across states.1. Identification StrategyTreatment Group: Fast-food restaurants in New Jersey ($NJ = 1$).Control Group: Fast-food restaurants in Pennsylvania ($NJ = 0$).Temporal Change: Before and after the April 1992 wage hike.2. Regression ModelThe primary specification is an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression on the change in employment ($\Delta FTE$):$$\Delta FTE_i = \alpha + \beta(NJ_i) + \gamma(X_i) + \epsilon_i$$Where $\beta$ represents the treatment effect. Alternatively, a fixed-effects panel model is used:$$FTE_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(NJ_i) + \beta_2(After_t) + \delta(NJ_i \times After_t) + \epsilon_{it}$$The coefficient $\delta$ captures the causal impact of the policy change.3. Identifying AssumptionsThe validity of this model rests on the Parallel Trends Assumption: in the absence of the minimum wage increase, the trend in employment for NJ restaurants would have been identical to the trend observed in PA.
